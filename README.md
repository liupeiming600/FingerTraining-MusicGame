# FingerTraining-MusicGame
****

Research background:  
Stroke patients usually have four stages of hand muscle recovery. Rehabilitation of the last sequela stage requires 1-2 years of training. However, traditional training, such as a hand exerciser, has no motivation for long-term rehabilitation.  
  
Research Objective: The study of using a music game application to improve patient motivation.  
Research content: 1. Using a Head-Mounted Display and a Windows system, develop an AR music game system with a training device of your own development. But stroke patients are basic seniors, heavy devices and HMDs are not available.  
2. Develop a convenient training device and connect it to a smartphone and Bluetooth connector. Develop a smartphone music game system.
